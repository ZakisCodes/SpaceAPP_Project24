# Methane Alert: Real-Time Emission Response System

Methane in the atmosphere is a significant contributor to climate change, acting as a potent greenhouse gas—over 25 times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat over a 100-year period. Methane emissions can lead to increased global temperatures, exacerbate extreme weather events, and contribute to air pollution, adversely impacting human health and ecosystems. 

Our project leverages the EMIT (Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation) NASA dataset to monitor and detect methane emissions in real-time. By analyzing data from this comprehensive dataset, we aim to provide actionable insights that can help address the challenges posed by methane emissions from agriculture and fossil fuel extraction. 

With our Methane Alert system, users can visualize methane emission data on an interactive map, receive real-time alerts for significant emission events, and gain insights into the geographical distribution of methane sources. This information is critical for promoting sustainable development and mitigating the effects of climate change.
